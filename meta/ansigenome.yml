        Reasons: To learn how networks work. Students donâ€™t have the permissions to actually sniff the network of course but there are [many dumps](https://wiki.wireshark.org/SampleCaptures) which can be analyzed.

    The compressed image size is currently 9.6 GiB which is tiny compared to a
    Windows 7 image (with basically nothing useful in it).

    The package list was generated for Linux Mint 17 LTS Qiana (based on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS).
    If you use a different distribution or release, checkout the Ansible role [ypid.packages][] which can help you to generate a matching package list.
    Once I have tested a different release, I will include the matching package lists to make them easier accessible.
